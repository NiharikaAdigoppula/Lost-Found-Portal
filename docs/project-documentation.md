# Lost & Found Portal - Vignan University

## Aim
To develop a centralized digital platform that streamlines the process of reporting, managing, and claiming lost items within Vignan University campus, enhancing the efficiency of item recovery and reducing the time and effort required to reunite lost items with their rightful owners.

## Introduction
The Lost & Found Portal for Vignan University is a modern web application designed to address the common challenge of managing lost and found items on university campuses. Traditional methods of handling lost items, such as physical lost and found offices or bulletin boards, are often inefficient and time-consuming. This digital solution provides a streamlined, accessible platform where students and staff can easily report found items and search for lost ones.

The platform leverages modern web technologies including React, Supabase, and real-time updates to create a seamless experience for users. It incorporates features such as image uploads, detailed item descriptions, and a sophisticated claim management system to ensure items are returned to their rightful owners efficiently and securely.
